# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame.

## About

This project is special to me — it was my very first coding project, created back in 2013. At the time, I was working as a system administrator, and this little game was my entry point into the world of programming. I’ve kept it in my repositories as a reminder of where my coding journey began and how much I’ve grown since then.
